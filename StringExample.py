#THis file will go through the basics of
#String Manipulation

#Strings are collections of characters
#String are enclosed in " " or ' '
# "Paul"
# "Paul is cool"
# "Paul is cool!"

#Two things we need to talk about
#when we think of strings
#index - Always starts at 0
#Length

#Example
# 0123		012345
# "Paul"		"Monkey"
# len("Paul") = 4
# len("Monkey") = 6

name = "Jace"

print(name) #I can print strings

sentence = name + "is cool"
print(sentence)
